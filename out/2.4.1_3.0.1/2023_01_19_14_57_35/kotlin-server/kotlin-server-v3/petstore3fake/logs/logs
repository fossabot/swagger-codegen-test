FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Directory '/home/runner/work/swagger-codegen/swagger-codegen/generated/kotlin-server-v3___petstore3fake___' does not contain a Gradle build.

A Gradle build should contain a 'settings.gradle' or 'settings.gradle.kts' file in its root directory. It may also contain a 'build.gradle' or 'build.gradle.kts' file.

To create a new Gradle build in this directory run 'gradle init'

For more detail on the 'init' task see https://docs.gradle.org/7.6/userguide/build_init_plugin.html

For more detail on creating a Gradle build see https://docs.gradle.org/7.6/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html

* Try:
